    description: "The life sciences industry is increasingly data-driven, with payors, providers, and manufacturers becoming both producers and consumers of rich, yet sometimes opaque data. At best, data utilization can guide business strategy and enable new, market leading capabilities. At worst, data can confuse and mislead. Our data strategy & innovation expertise enables clients to foster a culture of innovation and develop the data-driven capabilities needed to sustain competitive advantage. We help clients identify data gaps, select and work with third-party data vendors, develop an effective data strategy, create an analytics and data infrastructure, implement data governance processes, enable use cases, and drive operational excellence.",
